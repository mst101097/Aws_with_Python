The `NoCredentialsError` in your traceback indicates that `boto3` is unable to find AWS credentials to authenticate with AWS services. Hereâ€™s how you can resolve this issue:

### 1. **Configure AWS Credentials**

You need to ensure that AWS credentials are properly configured on your system. Since you are unable to use the AWS CLI, you can manually configure credentials for `boto3`.

#### **Method A: Set Environment Variables**

You can set AWS credentials using environment variables. In Git Bash or any terminal, set the following environment variables:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your_access_key'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your_secret_key'
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION='your_region'
```

Replace `'your_access_key'`, `'your_secret_key'`, and `'your_region'` with your actual AWS credentials and region.

To make these changes permanent, you can add them to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
echo 'export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_key"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="your_region"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### **Method B: Use AWS Credentials File**

1. **Create or Edit the AWS Credentials File**:
   - Create a file named `credentials` in the `.aws` directory in your home folder:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p ~/.aws
     nano ~/.aws/credentials
     ```

   - Add your credentials to this file:
     ```
     [default]
     aws_access_key_id = your_access_key
     aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_key
     ```

2. **Create or Edit the AWS Config File**:
   - Similarly, create a `config` file in the `.aws` directory:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.aws/config
     ```

   - Add your region to this file:
     ```
     [default]
     region = your_region
     ```

### 2. **Check for Correct Credentials**

Verify that your credentials are correctly configured by running the following Python code snippet:

```python
import boto3

# Create an IAM client
iam = boto3.client('iam')

try:
    response = iam.list_users()
    print("Users:")
    for user in response['Users']:
        print(f" - {user['UserName']}")
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

This code should list IAM users if the credentials are correctly set up.

### 3. **Verify Your `boto3` Configuration**

Ensure that `boto3` is correctly installed and that there are no conflicting configurations. You can check the version of `boto3` and `botocore`:

```bash
pip show boto3 botocore
```

### 4. **Update Credentials and Configuration**

If you need to update or rotate your credentials, make sure to replace the old ones with the new ones in both the environment variables and the `~/.aws/credentials` file.

### Summary

To resolve the `NoCredentialsError`, make sure your AWS credentials are correctly configured using environment variables or the credentials file. This will allow `boto3` to authenticate and interact with AWS services.
